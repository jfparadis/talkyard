/** What is onebox? If you post a comment that contains a link in a paragraph of its own,
  * and the link is to a trusted site, onebox will create a short snippet of the linked page,
  * for example, a title and short excerpt of a Wikipedia article, or a video player
  * if you link to YouTube.
  *
  * This usually requires the server to download the linked page from the target website,
  * and extract the relevant parts. When rendering client side, the client sends a request
  * to the server and asks it to create a onebox. We create oneboxes server side, so that we'll
  * be able to re-render comments server side, should this be needed for whatever reason.
  *
  * Inspired by Discourse's onebox, see: https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-is-a-onebox/4546
  *
  * The name comes from Google's search result box in which they sometimes show a single
  * answer directly.
